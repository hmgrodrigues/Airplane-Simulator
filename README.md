# Airplane-Simulator

This is a project based on JavaScript and WebGL library, where it simulates how an airplane flies and the way it moves.

It allows the user to control:

* The **yaw** by controlling the **rudder**: Use the **Q** and **E** keys
* The **pitch** by controlling the **elevators**: Use the **W** and **S** keys
* The **roll** by controlling the **ailerons**: Use the **A** and **D** keys
* The **prosultion** by controlling the rotation speed of the **engines/properllers**: Use the **R** and **F** keys

The view can be observed by one of the 4 pre-defined cameras associated to the airplane position:

* **Top** view: Use the **1** key
* **Lateral** view: Use the **2** key
* **Front** view: Use the **3** key
* **Chase** view: Use the **0** key

We can observe the shape of the airplane as (Use the **o** key to go from one to another):
