# Airplane-Simulator

This is a project based on **JavaScript** and **WebGL** library, where it simulates how an airplane flies and the way it moves.

A chess texture is being used as representation of the floor. Everytime the airplane reaches almost the end of each block of the texture a new block is generated in that direction.

## How to use it

It allows the user to control:

* The **yaw** by controlling the **rudder**: Use the "**Q**" and "**E**" keys
* The **pitch** by controlling the **elevators**: Use the "**W**" and "**S**" keys
* The **roll** by controlling the **ailerons**: Use the "**A**" and "**D**" keys
* The **propulsion** by controlling the rotation speed of the **engines/propellers**: Use the "**R**" and "**F**" keys

The view can be observed by one of the 4 pre-defined cameras associated to the airplane position:

* **Top** view: Use the "**1**" key
* **Lateral** view: Use the "**2**" key
* **Front** view: Use the "**3**" key
* **Chase** view (default): Use the "**0**" key

We can observe the shape of the airplane as (Use the "**O**" key to alternate):

* **Painted surfaces**
* **Wired shaped**
